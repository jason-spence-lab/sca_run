# Single Cell Analysis Applications in Python

This repository contains applications of [Scanpy](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy) used by the Jason Spence Lab. 

## Getting Started

To run this project, install Scanpy from [here](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy). Make sure to have a recent version of Python. As of June 2019, we are using Python version 3.7.3.

To understand the single cell analysis tools, check out the Scanpy and Seurat tutorials side-by-side [here](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html) and [here](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.0/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)

<!-- ### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
